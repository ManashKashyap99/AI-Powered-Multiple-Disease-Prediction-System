# AI-Powered-Multiple-Disease-Prediction-System
This project leverages deep learning to automate the diagnosis of multiple medical conditions, including Diabetes, Heart Disease and more. Using state-of-the-art machine learning models trained on publicly available datasets (Kaggle), the system identifies patterns in medical data to deliver highly accurate disease predictions.

Designed to assist healthcare professionals, this tool minimizes human error, enhances diagnostic precision, and promotes early disease detection. By integrating deep learning algorithms, it provides a reliable, efficient, and scalable solution for improving healthcare outcomes and supporting data-driven medical decisions.
